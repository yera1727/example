# The second change
I have to get used to use Git

#Basic git commands:

1.git clone <- once, to fetch the repository for the first time\
2.git pull <- get changes from server\
3.git add <- add files to commit (package, box)\
4.git push <- send the "box" to the server

#The third correction
"Hello World!"
